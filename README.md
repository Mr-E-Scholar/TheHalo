# TheHalo

The Halo Light System is the world’s first LED controller of its kind, designed specifically for cymatics use, incorporating smooth manual controls for the color and brightness of individual pixels. The circuitry, coding and design are results of our entire team's skills and experience, creating a product that will help all cymatics scientists, artists and musicians create custom hydroglyphic images for their work. 
Now available in upgradable-prototype form!

Here are some of the features of The Halo Basic Prototype unit:
• The Halo Light System is an LED light controller incorporating smooth manual controls for the color and brightness of individual pixels, and comes with the controller, light ring array and stand.
 • The light ring array consists of 104 neopixel SMDs arranged on three concentric rings each containing the 45, 35, and 24 programmable LEDs.
 • Using ring selection buttons and the red, blue and green sliders on the controller, you will be able to select which ring you would like to "paint", and then create ANY color you want on EACH single LED on that light ring! The colors within the triangle in the image on the site are achievable on these units.
 • Once you have created your custom color array, you can store your creation in any of the SIX storage spots available for later use.
 • Using the built-in recall function, you can recall a saved array to the live "canvas" and alter it to re-save as another array; this feature is great for creating sequences that can be manually-timed using the button that cycles through the stored arrays.
 • The brightness of the unit can be adjusted with an adjustable dimmer dial.
 • The red/blue/green slider values show up on the LCD screen as values between 0 and 255. Thus, to create "white", slide all of the sliders up to full so each of the red, blue and green values are 255. Yellow is achieved by sliding the red and green sliders to 255 while leaving the blue slider on 0. The User Guide included with each unit contains more information on these values and functions.
 • Each unit is upgradable to a later version, using the existing hardware.
 • The Halo is an incredible and versatile invention, with applications in cymatics, VJ/DJ productions, geometric art installations, and just about any situation where custom-color LED lighting is used!
